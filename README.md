Mini screen recoder using basic python tkinter. Just run the code and you will get several types of option
first one is screen recorder with voice , and then screen recorder without voice, the last one is stop.
SO if you select the fisrt option then it will record the screen with noice and voice and so on.
This is basic python code. You can convert it as exe file. 
For convert exe file just you have to write little command in your terminal 'pip install auto-py-to-exe'
After installing that run it. For run you have to write in terminal 'auto-py-to-exe' and press enter
Then just select the file from your derectory.
Very easy.
